# C++_Basics
C++ programs with basic logic

Here some basic programs on C++....

1.  1LSUM     : program to print the number after adding first and last digit of the given four digit number
2.  ADDDI1    : program to print the number after adding 1 in each digit of the given number
3.  ARMSTRON  : program to check the given number is armstrong or not.
               armstrong number is 153
               it means when cube of each digit of the number is added then it give the same number i.e. 1^3+5^3+3^3=153
4.  BASICSAL1 : to print net amount where basic salary is @ 12.5%             
5.  BASICSAL2 : to print net amount as per given condition when basic salary is get inputed
6.  BINARY    : program to print binary number of the given number
7.  CALCULATOR: if_else DMAS calculator
8.  CONE      : to find area and volume of cone
9.  EVENFACT  : to find even factor of the given number
10. FACT      : to find factor of the given number
11. FACTO     : program to find factorial of the given number
12. FACTO2    : program to find factorial till the given number
13. FIBONACCI : program to print fabonacci series till the given number.
                fabonacci series is that series in which it give the sum of the next two number if it start with zero and one the the series are as follows
                0,1,(0+1=)1,(1+1=)2,(2+1=)3,(2+3=)5,(3+5=)8,.........................
14. FUNHARSED : to find given number is harsed with function.
                harsed number is 1729 when the digit of the number is get sum and then that digit is get reversed and both get multiplied then the result is
                observed same number i.e. 1+7+2+9=19, reverse=91 and 19*91=1729                
15. HARSED    : harsed number without function
                A number is said to be harsed number if we add the digits of the given number
                and then get reversed that number and by multiplying these two number we get
                same number given. 1729 is harsed number
16. HCF       : to find hcf of the given number using if else
17. HCF2      : to find hcf of the given number using while
18. MAX       : to print maximum value from the given the values
19. ODDFACT   : to find odd factor of the given number
20. POWER     : to print the result of power of the number
